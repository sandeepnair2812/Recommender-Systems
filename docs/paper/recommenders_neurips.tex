\title{Microsoft Recommenders: Best Practices for Production-Ready Recommendation Systems}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
Recommendation systems have become one of the most widely applied areas of machine learning in modern business and 
have attracted great interest in machine learning research. Recommendation algorithms are involved in a large percentage of 
consumer purchases in today's e-commerce production systems. We present {\em Microsoft-Recommenders},  
an open-source Github repository for helping researchers, developers and non-experts in general to select, prototype, train and
bring to production a variety of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.
A focus of this repository is on {\em best practices} in development of recommendation systems and Python software for machine learning.
We have also incorporated learnings from our experience with recommendation systems in production, in order to enhance ease of use; speed of 
implementation and deployment; ease of evaluation; scalability and performance. 
The repository has also received contributions from the broader community of researchers and data science practitioners. 
In turn, the repository is a useful aid to anyone in this community and simplifies development and application of recommendation algorithms.
